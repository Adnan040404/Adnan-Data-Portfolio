âš¡ SQL Functions

Functions in SQL are powerful tools that allow you to perform operations on data, simplify queries, and improve reusability in database logic.

Built-In Functions

Provided by SQL itself.

Commonly used for tasks like string manipulation, mathematical calculations, date handling, and aggregations.

Examples: LEN(), GETDATE(), SUM(), AVG().

User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

Created by developers to handle specific requirements.

Allow encapsulating logic into reusable functions.
