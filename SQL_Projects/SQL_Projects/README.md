Core capabilities used in these projects:

CRUD Operations – Create, Read, Update, Delete

Joins – Combining data from multiple tables

Aggregate Functions – SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX

Subqueries & CTEs – Complex nested queries & modular code

Stored Procedures – Reusable query logic

Window Functions – Ranking, moving averages, running totals

🚀 Usage

Install a SQL Database (MySQL / SQL Server / PostgreSQL).

Import the .sql files into your environment.

Run queries to reproduce the analysis.

Modify queries as needed for your own datasets.
