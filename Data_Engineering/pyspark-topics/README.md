🔥 PySpark Tutorial for Beginners – Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to my PySpark Topics as a  Beginner repository! 🚀
This repo contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks with hands-on examples and code snippets to help you learn and practice PySpark concepts step by step.

📌 Overview

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark – a powerful framework for large-scale data processing and analytics.
In this repo, I cover PySpark fundamentals and provide practical examples for:

Spark Installation & Setup

SparkContext & SparkSession

RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) Transformations & Actions

Spark DataFrames

Spark SQL

These notebooks are designed for beginners in Data Engineering / Data Analytics who want to gain practical experience with PySpark.
