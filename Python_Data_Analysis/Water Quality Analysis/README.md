📌 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed water quality data to identify the key factors that determine whether water is safe for human consumption (potable) or unsafe (non-potable).
Using a Kaggle dataset, the study focuses on water characteristics such as pH, hardness, dissolved solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes (THMs), and turbidity.

This project contributes to water quality research and supports the global effort to ensure safe drinking water as a fundamental human right.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Analysis Performed

Distribution of Potability (0 = Not Potable, 1 = Potable)

Distribution of pH Levels

Distribution of Water Hardness

Distribution of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

Distribution of Chloramines

Distribution of Sulfate

Distribution of Conductivity

Distribution of Organic Carbon

Distribution of Trihalomethanes (THMs)

Distribution of Turbidity

⚡ Clear insights were drawn from visualizations to understand how each factor affects water quality.

📈 Key Insights

Most water samples were not potable, showing real-world challenges.

Extreme pH levels (too low or too high) correlated with unsafe water.

High hardness and dissolved solids (TDS) negatively impacted potability.

Organic carbon and THMs are critical factors that strongly influence water safety.

🚀 Future Work

Build an ML classification model to predict potability.

Deploy a dashboard (Power BI / Streamlit) to visualize results interactively.
